The aim of this porject is to conduct an exploratory analysis of data in relation to COVID-19 Deaths and COVID-19 Vaccinations. The aspects of the data analysed are as follows :

-Total Cases vs Total Deaths

-Total Cases vs Population

-Country with highest proportion of population infected

-Countries with highest number of deaths

-Global death percentage each day

-Continents with highest number of deaths

-Total Population vs Vaccinations: Percentage of population that has received atleast 1 dose of vaccination

Implemented SQL data exploration on global COVID‑19 datasets, using joins, window functions, CTEs, and views in SQL Server to derive population‑level case, mortality and vaccination insights.
